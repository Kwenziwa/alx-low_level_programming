# C -lists as a Data Structure
#### This project introduces list as a type of data structure
#### There are various types of list architcture, however, this project involves Singel-link list
The following task were done and they include:
* Prints all the elements of a linked list. [0-print_list.c](https://github.com/Kwenziwa/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists/0-print_list.c).
* Return the total number of nodes or elements in a linked list. [1-list_len.c](https://github.com/Kwenziwa/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists/1-list_len.c).
* Add a new node at the beginning of a linked list. [2-add_node.c](https://github.com/Kwenziwa/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists/2-add_node.c).
* Add a new node at the end of a linked list. [3-add_node_end.c](https://github.com/Kwenziwa/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists/3-add_node_end.c).
* Free or delete a node in the linked list. [4-free_list.c](https://github.com/Kwenziwa/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists/4-free_list.c).
* Using a constructor or destructor to help execute before the main. [100-first.c](https://github.com/Kwenziwa/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists/100-first.c).
* Assembly code for "Hello, Holberton". [101-hello_holberton.asm](https://github.com/Kwenziwa/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists/101-hello_holberton.asm).
